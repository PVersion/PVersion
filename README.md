## Progressive Versioning Specification

1. A progressive version number MUST contain an indispensable requisite, i.e., central version number, and MAY include an optional pre-release version number and an optional build metadata segment.
2. A central version number, which MUST consist of a foundation (base) version, a major version, a minor version, and a patch version, MUST take the form W.X.Y.Z where W, X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. W is the foundation (base) version, X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically.
