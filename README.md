## Progressive Versioning Specification

1. A progressive version number MUST contain an indispensable requisite, i.e., central version number, and MAY include an optional pre-release version number and an optional build metadata segment.
2. A central version number, which MUST consist of a foundation (base) version, a major version, a minor version, and a patch version, MUST take the form W.X.Y.Z where W, X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. W is the foundation (base) version, X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically.
3. A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen, and a pre-release version number, immediately following the central version number. A pre-release version number is a series of dot separated identifiers that MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics [a-zA-Z0-9] and MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions have lower precedence than the associated release versions with the same central version number but without a pre-release version number. A pre-release version indicates the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated release versions with the same central version number but without a pre-release version number.
